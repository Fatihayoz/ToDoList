## Vanilla JavaScript 'To do list'.

### Main goals: ###
 * practice **interaction** with each other on GitHub
 * get more familiar with **Git workflow**
 * practice **JavaScript**
  

We use [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ&t=2235s)'s 'to do list' as HTML and CSS starter to be able to concentrate on our main goals.
